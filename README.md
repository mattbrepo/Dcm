# Dcm (Document content manager)
This a [Document management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system) to store, label and search personal documents on a single computer. 

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2015**

## Why
I've been lost in hundreds of documents scattered in too many folders for years. I wanted a simple system that allowed me to store documents with labels (instead of archiving them in folders). I developed this simple [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) in Python, but later I abandoned this project in favor of a [GUI written in C#](https://github.com/mattbrepo/Calder1). 

## Example

Check the 'example' folder.

Write 'h' or 'help√¨ to show the help:

![Example1](/images/example1.jpg)

Write 'show' to list the files in the current repo:

![Example2](/images/example2.jpg)
