# Dcm (Document content manager)
This a [Document management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system) to store, label and search personal document on a single computer. 

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2015**

## Why
I had been lost in hundreds of documents scattered in too many folders for years. I wanted a simple system that allowed me to store a document with labels (instead of folders). I developed this simple [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) written in Python, but later I abandoned this project in favor of a [GUI written in C#](https://github.com/mattbrepo/Calder1). 

## Example
